# SnailPass-REST-API
$${\color{red}STILL \space\space IN \space\space DEVELOPMENT}$$

SnailPass is a future password manager that I'm writing with my colleagues. It will be supporting three different platforms: Windows, Android and IOS.
And this repository is a REST api for the project. We will be using AES-256-CBC and PBKDF2(SHA-512) algorithms to encrypt all the password data and hash master passwords.</br></br>
