# SnailPass-REST-API
**STILL IN DEVELOPMENT**</br></br>
SnailPass is a future password manager that will be supporting three platforms: Windows, Android and IOS.
And this repository is a REST API for the project. We will be using AES-256-CBC and PBKDF2(SHA-512) algorithms to encrypt all the password data and hash master passwords.</br></br>
The goal is to copy [Bitwarden's](https://github.com/bitwarden) system architecture as close as possible.

# Screenshots
Interface of the Windows client will probably look something like this:
